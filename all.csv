Testimonials from tenants

Previous tenant
""Quite simply, this is by far the best place I have ever lived. From the stunning view, to the easy access to all that Southside has to offer, I couldn't have imagined securing a better deal than I did. The skylights always created beautiful mornings, and the view from the back balcony created some really great memories. Walt was a fantastic apartment manager, always ready and able to assist at a moment's notice. I would recommend this apartment to anyone and would be happy to talk about it with a potential leasee seeking to gain insight from a former tenant"".

Previous tenant.
I rented the 2701 Mission St apartment for one year... it was amazing. I loved the location, the south side slopes, walking distance to Carson Street. The apartment was just off the city public steps, so perfect for me to walk to work as well as go out with friends on evenings and weekends. Parking was never a problem between my own parking spot at the bottom of the house or free street parking at the top. The neighbors were all very nice. Tons of peace and quiet, a spectacular view and great private porch to enjoy it on. 

I'll add Walt was a great apartment manager and awesome with communication. Quickly responded if I ever had any problems with the apartment, which I never did. And would be mindful of my privacy if ever he needed to swing by. I would recommend this unit to anyone.

This complex at 5511 Baum, 5515 Baum and 5519 Baum used to be two large single-family mansions which were built decades ago. Our company bought both mansions in 2012 and turned them into 27 apartments. We saved some of the original features of the mansions, such as stained-glass windows, but all plumbing, electric, drywall, windows, HVAC and flooring is new. All 27 kitchens and 27 bathrooms are, of course, new.

This property is only blocks from lots of shops and restaurants including Market District, Giant Eagle-Shadyside, Aldi, Rite Aid, Crazy Mocha, Wendy's, Panera and so much more. The busway to quickly get you downtown is only a 5 minute walk away. 
One assigned parking space is included with each apartment and additional spots may be available at a discounted rate for tenants. 
All of our properties are pet friendly for friendly pets with a two pet maximum, and there is a little park less than a block away from this building for dogs to enjoy. We require proof of vaccinations and licenses, but we do not charge additional rent or fees for pets.Read less",1295.0
