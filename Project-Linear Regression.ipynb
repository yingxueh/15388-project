    "In this homework we are going to apply linear regression to the problem of predicting developer satisfaction based upon information about their carrers, from a StackOverflow survey.  The data from this question is based on the [2019 StackOverflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019); accordingly, the subset bundled with this assignment is also released under the Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0.  For this problem, you should not use Scikit-Learn, but instead implement all the least squares solutions manually.\n"

(Note that it is common practice to randomize the dataset; this has already been done. Don't shuffle the dataset for this assignment.)\n",
